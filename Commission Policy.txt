COMMISSION POLICY 
4. Commissions Earned 
All commissions that are paid are considered commission advances until they are fully earned, at which point no commission adjustments will be applied. Sales commissions that have been advanced for a sale are considered fully earned if the following criteria are met: 
a) All applicable commission adjustments, if any, have been applied (see provision on Commission Adjustments); 
b) You are a current active employee; 
c) You have followed all company procedures related to the sale. If these procedures are not followed, a payroll reduction may be applied. 
5. Commission Adjustments 
5.1. Requests to Withdrawal 
If a customer who you enrolled requests to withdraw from the program within 72 hours after the enrollment agreement was signed, your total commission due on the sale will be recalculated as described below. Please note that this 72 hours timeframe does not include any period where a customer’s account payment status in the CRM is ‘Loan or PIF Payment Freeze’, ‘Loan Reduced Payment’, or ‘Delayed Start.’ Once the account status is no longer on hold, the 72 hours count resumes. 
a) If the Retention Department is able to save your enrolled customer from withdrawing from the program and you are an active employee, your total commission due on the 
sale will not change unless the customer’s course package is modified to prevent the 
customer from withdrawing. In this case, your total commission due on the sale will be recalculated based on the updated course package. Any overpayment or underpayment of commissions will be added or deducted on a following paycheck. 
b) If the Retention Department is not able to save your enrolled customer from 
withdrawing from the program and the customer is issued a refund, your total 
commission due on the sale will be recalculated based on the amount collected from the customer prior to the withdrawal request minus the refund amount. Any overpayment of commission on this sale is then deducted on a following paycheck. No commission will be advanced on any monies collected after a customer withdraws (i.e. subsequent payment(s) on contractual financial obligation and/or early termination fee). 
5.2. Deposit Payment - Check/ACH Payment Bounces or Credit Card Payment Reversed by Customer 
If within 30 days after the specified ‘Deposit Met Date’ in the CRM, the customer’s deposit payment is reversed due to insufficient funds, a stop payment on a check/ACH transaction, and/or a chargeback or threat of chargeback by the customer of a credit card payment, the original sale is no

COMMISSION POLICY 
longer considered a sale. Subsequently, you are no longer eligible for a commission advance on the original sale. Any previously advanced commission will be deducted on a following paycheck. Note, if a customer’s credit card chargeback is reversed, the Deposit Met Date will be updated in the CRM to the date that the credit card chargeback was reversed and any prior commission deductions that were applied when the customer initiated the chargeback will be reinstated and added to a following paycheck. 
5.3. PIF Installment Payments - Check/ACH Payment Bounces or Credit Card Payment Reversed by Customer 
If within 30 days after the customer’s PIF installment payment is received, the payment is reversed due to insufficient funds, a stop payment on a check/ACH transaction, and/or a chargeback or threat of chargeback by the customer of a credit card payment, your total commission due will be recalculated to be based upon the amount collected from the customer excluding the reversed amount. Any overpayment of commissions advanced on this sale is then deducted on a following paycheck. Note, if a customer’s credit card chargeback is reversed, the Deposit Met Date will be updated in the CRM to the date the credit card chargeback was reversed and any prior commission deductions that were applied when the customer initiated the chargeback will be reinstated and added to a following paycheck. 
5.4. Account Status Changes to Loan or PIF Payment Freeze, Loan Reduced Payment, or Delayed Start 
If a customer who you enrolled requests within 72 hours after the enrollment agreement was signed to freeze scheduled payments, reduce scheduled loan payments, or delay start of program, your commission due will be recalculated to be based only upon the amount collected from the customer prior to the request and no Financed commission, if applicable, will be advanced. Any overpayment of commission on this sale is then deducted on a following paycheck. If the customer’s account status is taken off hold within 180 days of the request and you are still an active employee, any prior commission deductions that were applied when the customer’s account went on hold will be reinstated (subject to any program modifications) and added to a following paycheck based on applicable payment schedule. Any Financed commission will also be advanced per applicable payment schedule. 
5.5. Program Modifications - Dropping of Enrolled Courses 
If a customer’s course package is reduced due to the circumstances noted below, your commission will be recalculated to be based upon the new total sale amount. Any overpayment of commission on the sale is then deducted from a following paycheck. 
a) Course package is reduced within 72 hours after the enrollment agreement was signed.

b) Course package is reduced as a result of transcript review and/or a Degree Planning Report meeting. 
c) Course package is reduced in conjunction with the customer’s payment method being changed from an Achieve Financed option to a PIF option within 60 days after the 
enrollment agreement was signed. 
5.6. Program Modifications - Addition of Enrolled Courses 
If a customer’s course package is increased due to circumstances noted below, your commission will be recalculated to be based upon the new total sale amount. Any underpayment of commission on the sales is then added to a following paycheck based on applicable payment schedule. 
a) Course package is increased within 72 hours after the enrollment agreement was signed. b) Course package is increased as a result of transcript review and/or a Degree Planning Report meeting. 
c) Course package is increased in conjunction with the customer’s payment method being changed from an Achieve Financed option to a PIF option within 60 days after the

5.7. Program Modifications - Change to Payment Method 
If within 60 days after the enrollment agreement was signed the payment method of a sale is changed in the CRM from an Achieve Financed option to a PIF option and you are an active employee, your commission due will be recalculated at the commission rate for the new payment method (see also provision 5.5). Any underpayment or overpayment of commission due on this sale is then added or deducted on a following paycheck based upon applicable payment schedule. 
If at anytime the payment method of a sale is changed in the CRM from a PIF option to an Achieve Financed option and you are an active employee, your commission due will be recalculated at the commission rate for the new payment method and will be based on the total sale amount minus any PIF installment payments made prior to the payment method change. Any underpayment or overpayment of commission due on this sale is then added or deducted to a following paycheck based on applicable payment schedule. 
5.8 Violation of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 
Should management determine that you acted for personal gain at the detriment of a customer and/or the Company, any commission on the related sale is subject to forfeit and such violation will result in disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination. These actions include but are not limited to misleading a customer through verbal and/or written communication and/or through omission of information that should have been relayed to a customer.

COMMISSION POLICY 
6. “Draw” Against Future Commissions 
Employee may, at some time during his/her employment, receive a payroll advance against future commissions. This payroll advance is called a “Draw.” Employee understands and agrees that this Draw is an advance against future commissions earned, a loan, which Employee is responsible to pay back to Employer by way of earned commissions or other means. At the time of the Employee’s termination from Employer (voluntary or involuntary), should Employee’s commissions earned fail to cover his/her Draw Balance, Employee understands and agrees that he/she shall be responsible to repay to Employer, upon demand by Employer, any portion of the Draw which was not satisfied by earned commissions. Furthermore, any remaining Draw Balance will be deducted from the Employee’s final paycheck (regardless of the type of pay included in the paycheck such as base salary, vacation payout, commissions, bonus, etc.). 
7. Booker Commissions 
In addition to sales commissions, all Admissions Representatives are eligible to earn booker commissions by scheduling sales appointments for other Admissions Representatives. These booker commissions are earned when the scheduled appointment is actually held and the “Show/No Show” status on the appointment record in the CRM is set to “Show.” No booker commission is earned when the prospective student does not attend 
the scheduled appointment (i.e. “No Show”). 
Your booker commission rate for the scheduled appointment corresponds to the “Lead Status” value in the CRM at time of booking, as shown below.

Notwithstanding the table above, your booker commission rate for appointments conducted over the phone (not via virtual online conference) is $3.04. The trigger for this commission value is when the “Meeting Via?” field on the appointment record in the CRM is set to “Phone”.

COMMISSION POLICY 
Please note that if you reschedule a “No Show” appointment that was originally booked by someone else and if the time of the rescheduled appointment is within 76 weekday hours of the original appointment time, the booker commission is allocated to the person who scheduled the original appointment. 
8. Payment of Commission 
Commissions are paid in the biweekly paycheck that corresponds to the pay period in which (1) deposit payments related to a sale are received and cleared, (2) PIF installment payments are received and cleared, and/or (3) the one-third distribution timeline kicks in for Achieve financed sales (see provisions 2.1 and 2.2 on Sales Commissions for details on these triggering events). The commissions are advanced at that time, but this does not mean that they have been earned at that time (see provision on Commissions Earned). 
9. Sales Commission Sharing 
There are certain circumstances in which another Admissions Representative may be entitled to some or all of your commissions. If another Admissions Representative helps to close an enrollment after the lead record in the CRM has reached “Dropped Ball” status, that Admissions Representative is entitled to 50% of the sales commission. In addition, if a customer requests another Admissions Representative and the new Admissions Representative closes the enrollment, the sales commission may be split at management’s discretion. 
10. Entire Policy 
This commission policy constitutes the entire policy between the parties. No representation, promise, or inducement not included in this commission policy shall be binding upon any party hereto. This policy is not considered a guarantee of continuous employment and by no means does this agreement affect the Employee’s at-will status with Employer. You will remain an at-will employee at all times during your employment with Employer unless otherwise classified by applicable state law. This commission policy and the terms and conditions herein may not be amended, modified, or waived except by the written agreement of the company. The company may change, append, or terminate this commission agreement at any time for any reason. You will be notified in writing in advance of any such changes. 
Unless prohibited by applicable law, the laws of the State of New Jersey shall govern the interpretation of this commission policy. You consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of a court in Morris County, New Jersey for purposes of enforcement of this Policy, and any and all disputes hereunder shall be litigated therein. You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted on an individual basis only and not in a class or representative action or as a named or unnamed member in a class, consolidated, representative or private attorney general action, unless both you and the company specifically agree to do so in writing following the initiation of the arbitration.
